# LC_BUILD_VERSION
`LC_BUILD_VERSION` tells what platform and version a binary is built for. It replaces the old `LC_VERSION_MIN_*` (`LC_VERSION_MIN_MACOSX`, `LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS`, `LC_VERSION_MIN_WATCHOS`, `LC_VERSION_MIN_TVOS`) commands and adds version for a few tools (`clang`, `swift`, `ld`).

``` c
struct build_version_command {
    uint32_t	cmd;        /* LC_BUILD_VERSION */
    uint32_t	cmdsize;
    uint32_t	platform;   /* platform */
    uint32_t	minos;      /* X.Y.Z is encoded in nibbles xxxx.yy.zz */
    uint32_t	sdk;        /* X.Y.Z is encoded in nibbles xxxx.yy.zz */
    uint32_t	ntools;     /* number of tool entries following this */
};
```

``` c
struct version_min_command {
    uint32_t	cmd;        /* LC_VERSION_MIN_MACOSX or
                               LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS or
                               LC_VERSION_MIN_WATCHOS or
                               LC_VERSION_MIN_TVOS */
    uint32_t	cmdsize;    /* sizeof(struct min_version_command) */
    uint32_t	version;    /* X.Y.Z is encoded in nibbles xxxx.yy.zz */
    uint32_t	sdk;        /* X.Y.Z is encoded in nibbles xxxx.yy.zz */
};
```

Previously, to differentiate a binary that is built for macOS or iOS simulator (both are x86_64), we need to check if `MIN_MACOSX` or `MIN_IPHONEOS` presents. The M1 chip makes things more complicated. It's impossible to differentiate arm64 iOS simulator build and iOS device build in the old way. With the new `LC_BUILD_VERSION`, combining the architecture in the Mach-O header, we are able to tell which build of a binary through the `platform` field (`IOS`, `IOSSIMULATOR`, `MACOS` and [more](https://github.com/qyang-nj/llios/blob/1f111edc87adbca68c336d3ab501e3ca4a1f2356/apple_open_source/cctools/include/mach-o/loader.h#L1265-L1275)).

Another interesting thing is that the version number is encoded in a 32-bit integer (16 bits for major version, 8 bits for minor version and 8 bits for patch version), so **the maximum of minor version is 15**. This is probably why Apple decided to set macOS version from 10.15 (Catalina) straight to 11 (Big Sur), after being version 10.x for about twenty years.

To change the build version of a binary after building, we can use `vtool` that is provided by Xcode.
```
xcrun vtool -set-build-version <platform> <minos> <sdk> -replace -output <new_binary> <binary>
```
