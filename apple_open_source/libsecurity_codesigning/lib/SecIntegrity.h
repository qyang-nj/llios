	@header SecIntegrity
	This header provides functionality that allows a program to use its own
	code signature to extend trust to parts of its bundle that it covers.
	
	This file does not help you verify code signatures themselves; use SecCode.h
	for that. It is reasonable to use SecCode.h and SecIntegrity.h together.
