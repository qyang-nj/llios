		a group of files; a CFNumber denoting an existing rule by rule number, or NULL to perform
		global changes.
	@param flags Operation flags and options. Pass kSecAssessmentDefaultFlags for default

	Context keys and values:

	@constant kSecAssessmentContextKeyEdit Required context key describing the kind of change
		requested to the system policy configuration. Currently understood values:
	@constant kSecAssessmentUpdateOperationAdd Add a new rule to the assessment rule database.
	@constant kSecAssessmentUpdateOperationRemove Remove rules from the rule database.
	@constant kSecAssessmentUpdateOperationEnable (Re)enable rules in the rule database.
	@constant kSecAssessmentUpdateOperationDisable Disable rules in the rule database.
	@constant kSecAssessmentUpdateOperationFind Locate and return rules from the rule database.
		This operation does not change the database, and does not require authorization or privileges.
		
	@constant kSecAssessmentUpdateKeyAuthorization A CFData containing the external form of a
		system AuthorizationRef used to authorize the change. The call will automatically generate
		a suitable authorization if this is missing; however, if the request is on behalf of
		another client, an AuthorizationRef should be created there and passed along here.
	@constant kSecAssessmentUpdateKeyPriority CFNumber denoting a (floating point) priority
		for the rule(s) being processed.
	@constant kSecAssessmentUpdateKeyLabel CFString denoting a label string applied to the rule(s)
		being processed.
	@constant kSecAssessmentUpdateKeyExpires CFDate denoting an (absolute, future) expiration date
		for rule(s) being processed.
	@constant kSecAssessmentUpdateKeyAllow CFBoolean denoting whether a new rule allows or denies
		assessment. The default is to allow; set to kCFBooleanFalse to create a negative (denial) rule.
	@constant kSecAssessmentUpdateKeyRemarks CFString containing a colloquial description or comment
		about a newly created rule. This is mean to be human readable and is not used when evaluating rules.
	
	Keys returned as the result of a successful kSecAssessmentUpdateOperationFind operation:
	
	@constant kSecAssessmentRuleKeyID A CFNumber uniquely identifying a rule.
	@constant kSecAssessmentRuleKeyPriority A CFNumber indicating the rule's priority.
		This is a floating point number. Higher values indicate higher priority.
	@constant kSecAssessmentRuleKeyAllow A CFBoolean indicating whether the rule allows (true) or denies (false) the operation.
	@constant kSecAssessmentRuleKeyLabel An optional CFString labeling the rule. Multiple rules may have the same label;
		this can be used to group rules. Labels are not presented to the user. The label has no effect on evaluation.
	@constant kSecAssessmentRuleKeyRemarks An optional CFString containing user-readable text characterizing the rule's meaning.
		The remark has no effect on the evaluation.
	@constant kSecAssessmentRuleKeyRequirement A CFString containing the (text form of) the code requirement governing the rule's match.
	@constant kSecAssessmentRuleKeyType A CFString denoting the type of operation governed by the rule.
		One of the kSecAssessmentOperationType* constants.
	@constant kSecAssessmentRuleKeyExpires A CFDate indicating when the rule expires. Absent if the rule does not expire. Expired rules are never returned.
	@constant kSecAssessmentRuleKeyDisabled A CFNumber; non zero if temporarily disabled. Optional.
	@constant kSecAssessmentRuleKeyBookmark A CFData with the bookmark to the rule. Optional.
